# QuickTrends 

QuickTrends is a website that I have been working on using Pythons Django Framework. The idea is to build something that anyone can use to track their sales data for their business or hobby. 

At a glance you will be able to see your performance to target and you get records of your sales in order to get monthly/yearly/daily statements. This should be useful for hobby projects where you make and sell things as well as small businesses that need a simple to use tool that will give useful data.



## Progress

This is under development, currently the data models and back end are almost done. The graphs will come next, and then I will be able to extend functionality and expand to new types of graphs and visualizations for the home screen. 

### To Do
- Finish Model methods for calling data

- Function to make graph and export to HTML

- Extend Model attributes, more data, more visualizations

- Host site
